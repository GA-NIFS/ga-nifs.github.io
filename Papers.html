												Distant quasars (QSOs) are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. High-redshift merging systems, 
												containing two or more supermassive black holes (BH) surrounded by close companions, tidal bridges, and tails on
												kiloparsec scales, represent an expected phenomenon, as evidenced by the first spatially resolved spectroscopic
												observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The study of these systems provides crucial insights for 
												constraining key components of galaxy evolution models, enhancing our understanding of galaxy growth and the feedback 
												effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) throughout the history of the Universe.
												In this work, we present the QSO in the merging system BR1202-0725: one of the best laboratories at z~4.7. The quasar
												is located about 24 kpc from a submillimetre galaxy with evidence of heavily dusty BH at its center and a powerful outflow
												expelling ~5 × 10⁶ M⊙ of ionized gas at ~5000 km/s, comparable to outflows in luminous QSOs. Thus, they form one of the most
												distant close pairs of AGN known so far. Additionally, this merger is one of the most overdense fields known in the early
												universe formed also by the three Lyα emitters and four companion galaxies. Using JWST observations, we estimated the
												BH properties and characterized the interstellar medium of the system. Our goal is to investigate the physical conditions
												and ionizing mechanisms, as well as to assess the impact of dual black holes driving outflows at high redshift.

												A key phase of galaxy evolution is the rapid transition (< 2Gyr) from early galaxy assembly at ‘cosmic dawn’
												(i.e., z>6) to the so-called ‘cosmic noon’ (z~1-3), where the cosmic density of both star formation rate (SFR) and 
												SMBH accretion rate peak. Galaxy growth is thus closely tied to AGN activity, yet little is known about the impact
												of AGN feedback beyond z~3, especially in the ionized gas phase. 
												The GA-NIFS JWST/NIRSpec GTO program includes the largest sample of AGN at z~3-6 with available rest-frame 
												optical spatially-resolved spectroscopy collected with JWST/NIRSpec/IFU (Perna+25b). <br>
												In this paper, we presented our study to characterize AGN outflows in such a sample of z~3-6 AGN selected from COSMOS to have log($L_{\rm X}$/erg/s)>44. We mapped the ionized emission of AGN (Halpha, [OIII], Hbeta, …) at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad components tracing outflows from the gas at rest with the galaxy. We derived outflow properties from spatially-resolved and integrated spectra (e.g., velocity, outflow mass rate) and compared them with those of the galaxy and of the AGN, retrieved from dedicated SED fitting. We compared our results with literature AGN from the local Universe to earlier cosmic epochs, spanning a very broad range of AGN luminosity.
												To account for the very different assumptions regarding the outflow density, we made the choice of comparing our results with the literature by parameterizing this parameter while homogenizing the various collected measurements.
												We find that outflows observed in COS-AGNi are well consistent with the previous results in the 
												<span class="math">\(\dot{M}_{\rm out}\)</span> versus 
												<span class="math">\(L_{\rm bol}\)</span>, 
												<span class="math">\(\dot{E}_{\rm out}\)</span> versus 
												<span class="math">\(L_{\rm bol}\)</span>, and 
												<span class="math">\(v_{\rm max}\)</span> versus 
												<span class="math">\(L_{\rm bol}\)</span> parameter spaces and that they mostly fall close to or above previous scaling relations (Fiore+17, Bischetti+19b, Musiimenta+23). Lastly, we find no clear redshift evolution of 
												<span class="math">\(\dot{M}_{\rm out} n_{\rm e} / L_{\rm bol}\)</span> and 
												<span class="math">\(\dot{E}_{\rm out} n_{\rm e} / L_{\rm bol}\)</span> beyond 
												<span class="math">\(z &gt; 1\)</span>. 
												In general, the trends shown by GA-NIFS AGNi at z>3 are similar to those observed at lower redshifts, suggesting that the nature of AGN feedback does not significantly evolve beyond z=3.

											Galaxy mergers can drive gas onto central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), forming dual active galactic nuclei (AGN). 
												The fraction of AGN pairs provides key insights into galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and co-evolution with 
												their hosts. However, identifying dual AGN remains challenging due to the need for high-quality spatial and 
												spectral data, with only a few detected at high redshifts. We estimate the fraction of dual AGN at 2 &lt;z &lt; 6 
												by analysing 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec in integral field mode as part of the GA-NIFS survey. 
												For two targets, we include archival VLT/MUSE data to extend the search area. We identify companion galaxies and 
												emission-line sources within the ∼20×20 kpc NIRSpec field of view, extending to ∼50 kpc with MUSE. 
												Their spectra are analysed to determine physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery 
												of a triple AGN and four dual AGN, with projected separations of 3–28 kpc. This more than doubles the number of 
												known multiple AGN at z > 3 within these separations. The estimated fraction of multiple AGN (∼20–30%) 
												exceeds previous observational constraints and moderately surpasses predictions from cosmological simulations (∼10%). 
												These results demonstrate NIRSpec’s exceptional ability to detect distant dual AGN and motivate further studies to 
												refine their occurrence across cosmic time.

												Outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, shaping the galaxy mass function at the high and low mass end
												by expelling and heating the gas in the galaxy and suppressing star formation. Low-z studies suggest that 
												outflows are multiphase, and now, for the first time with the advent of JWST we can observe the rest-frame
												optical emission line from high redshift galaxies, expand our search for ionized outflows up to the early Universe.
												In this work, we analyze the JWST NIRSpec/IFU data of HZ4, a main sequence, star-forming galaxy at z=5.5, 
												which is the highest redshift star forming galaxy with a neutral outflow traced by the broad [CII] emission. 
												These data, together with the ALMA observations allow us to characterize the properties of the different phases
												of the ISM. In particular we find the presence of an ionized outflow identified as a broad component in the [OIII]
												and Hα emission lines. The outflow is launched by a region hosting a burst of star formation, with the mass 
												outflow rate of the ionized phase being smaller than the neutral one. These two phases are expelling from the
												star forming region the same amount of gas that is converted into stars. This dataset allows us to study for the 
												first time the properties multiphase properties of a star-formation driven outflow at z~5.5.

											Recent JWST observations revealed several galaxies with extreme nitrogen enhancements in the early Universe, whose
											enrichment mechanisms remain debated. In this work, we present the chemical abundance pattern of GS_3073, a galaxy at z=5.55
											hosting an ​``overmassive'' active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines from JWST/NIRSpec IFU 
											observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. By using rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density
											($\sim 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and highly ionized gas, we derive an abundance ratio of $\rm log(N/O) = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$. 
											At an estimated metallicity of $0.2~Z_{\odot}$, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich galaxy found by JWST thus far. 
											In comparison, the relative carbon abundance of GS_3073 is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars 
											with similar metallicities. We also find evidence of Fe enrichment in GS_3073. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of 
											GS_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars, ejecta from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or winds 
											from Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace low-density and low-ionization gas,
											we find a sub-solar N/O ratio, consistent with local galaxies at the same metallicity. 
											We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the 
											inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a
											benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen enhancement in high-$z$ galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly 
											ionized regions, while the bulk of the galaxy evolves more normally.

											There is compelling evidence that the most massive galaxies in the Universe stopped forming stars due to the
											time-integrated feedback from their central super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However, the exact quenching mechanism
											is not yet understood, because local massive galaxies were quenched billions
											of years ago. We present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of GS-10578,
											a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift $z = 3.064 \pm 0.002$.
											From the spectrum we infer that the galaxy has a stellar mass of $M_\star = 1.6 \pm
											0.2 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a dynamical mass $M_\mathrm{dyn} = 2.0 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{11}
											\mathrm{M}_\odot$ . Half of
											its stellar mass formed at $z = 3.7–4.6$, and the system is now quiescent, with
											an upper limit on the current star-formation rate $SFR < 19 \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$. We detect
											ionised- and neutral-gas outflows traced by $\mathrm{[O\,\scriptsize{iii}]}$ emission and
											$\mathrm{Na\,\scriptsize{I}}$ absorption. Outflow velocities reach
											$v_\mathrm{out} \approx 1,000 \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$, comparable to the galaxy
											escape velocity. GS-10578 hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), evidence
											that these outflows are due to SMBH feedback. The outflow rates are 0.14–2.9
											and 30–100 $\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{−1}}$ for the ionised and neutral phases, respectively.
											The neutral outflow rate is higher than the SFR, hence this is direct evidence for ejective
											SMBH feedback, with mass-loading capable of interrupting star formation by
											rapidly removing its fuel. Stellar kinematics show ordered rotation, with spin
											parameter $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}} = 0.62\pm0.07$, meaning GS-10578 is rotation supported. This study
											shows direct evidence for ejective AGN feedback in a massive, recently quenched
											galaxy, thus helping to clarify how SMBHs quench their hosts. The high value
											of $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ implies that quenching can occur without destroying the stellar disc.

											In this paper,  we present rest-frame optical data of the 𝑧 ∼ 4 sub-millimeter galaxy GN2. The H𝛼 emission is asymmetric and clumpy and extends over a projected distance of more than 15 kpc. To first order, the large-scale ionised gas kinematics are consistent with a turbulent (𝜎 ∼ 90 km/s), rotating disc (𝑣rot ∼ 500 km/s), congruent with previous studies of its molecular and ionised gas kinematics. However, we also find clear evidence for non-circular motions in the H𝛼 kinematics. We discuss their possible connection with various scenarios, such as external perturbations, accretion or radial flows. In the centre of GN20, we find broad line emission (FWHM ∼ 1000−2000 km/s) in the H𝛼+[NII] complex, suggestive of fast, AGN-driven winds or, alternatively, of the broad-line region of an active black hole. Elevated values of [NII]𝜆6583/H𝛼 > 0.4 and EW(H𝛼) > 6 Å throughout large parts of GN20 suggest that feedback from the active black hole is able to photo-ionise the interstellar medium. Our data corroborates that GN20 offers a unique opportunity to observe key processes in the evolution of the most massive present-day galaxies acting in concert, over 12 billion years ago.  <br>

											We present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of the z~9.11 lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1. The data was obtained with both the G395H grating
											(R∼2700) and the prism (R∼100). This target shows a main elongated UV-bright clump and a secondary component detected in continuum emission at a projected distance
											of 2 kpc. The R2700 data trace the ionised-gas morpho-kinematics in between the two components, showing an elongated emission mainly traced by [O III]λ5007. 
											We spatially resolve [OII]λλ3726,3729, [OIII]λλ4959,5007, and [OIII]λ4363, which enable us to map the electron density (ne∼1.0 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), 
											temperature (Te ∼ 1.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> K), and direct-method gas-phase metallicity (-1.2 to -0.7 dex solar). 
											A spatially resolved full-spectrum modelling of the prism indicates a north-south gas metallicity and stellar age gradient between the two components. 
											We found 3-σ evidence of a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, which is likely driven by gas inflows, 
											enhancing the star formation in JD1. We employ high-z sensitive diagnostic diagrams to rule out the presence of a strong AGN in the main component. 
											These findings show the unambiguous presence of two distinct stellar populations, with the majority of the mass ascribed to an old star formation burst, as suggested by previous works. 
											We disfavour the possibility of a rotating-disc nature for MACS1149-JD1 and instead favour a merger event that has led to a recent burst of star formation in two separate regions, 
											as supported by high values of [O III]λ5007/Hβ, ionised gas velocity dispersion, and gas-phase metallicity.

											A surprising finding of recent studies is the large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) associated with moderately massive black holes ( log(M•/M⊙) ∼ 6 − 8), in the first billion years after the big bang (z > 5). In this context, a relevant finding has been the large fraction of candidate dual AGN, both at large separations (several kpc) and in close pairs (less than a kpc), likely in the process of merging. Frequent black hole merging may be a route for black hole growth in the early universe; however,previous findings are still tentative and indirect. We present JWST/NIRSpec-IFU observations of the galaxy system ZS7 at z = 7.15 in which we find evidence for a log(M•/M⊙) ∼ 7.7 accreting black hole, as traced by a broad component of Hβ emission, associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) around the black hole. This BLR is offset by 620 pc in projection from the centroid of strong rest-frame optical emission, with a velocity offset of ∼40 km/s. The latter region is also characterized by (narrow) nebular emission features typical of AGN, hence also likely hosting another accreting black hole, although obscured. We exclude that the offset BLR is associated with Supernovae or massive stars, and we interpret these results as two black holes in the process of merging. This finding may be relevant for estimates of the rate and properties of gravitational-wave signals from the early universe that will be detected by future observatories like LISA. <br>

											GS4891 is a massive, highly star-forming galaxy part of a system of at least three galaxies at z~3.7, 
											together with a system at the north GS4891_n and GS28356. NIRSpec/IFS observations have revealed internal 
											substructure in GS4891 in the form of star-forming clumps (C1 and C2) as well as a complex interplay of 
											interactions and internal feedback within the group. Analyses of the rest-frame optical emission lines 
											have shown a clear gradient of more than 0.2 dex in the gas metallicity from the south to the north-west 
											of the most-massive system (GS4891), suggesting ongoing accretion of low-metallicity gas from the inter-galactic
											medium that would be contributing to the mass-assembly of the system. The even higher gas metallicity in the 
											lower-mass companion at the north (GS4891_n) also suggests that the accretion of low-metallicity gas is favored 
											in the most-massive system, a scenario that would lead to a different evolution in the metallicity of satellites
											and centrals at high redshift. The gas kinematics of the most-massive galaxy are consistent with rotation in a 
											dark-matter dominated system. Moreover, this galaxy is host to a metal-enriched, nuclear ionized outflow that
											reaches up to ~1.2 kpc and could be contributing to the observed metallicity gradient.

										 <font color="black">  Massive, starbursting galaxies in the early Universe represent some of the most extreme objects in the study of galaxy evolution. One such source is HFLS3 (z∼6.34), which was originally identified as an extreme starburst galaxy with mild gravitational magnification (μ∼2.2). Here, we present
										new observations of HFLS3 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in both low (PRISM/CLEAR; R∼100) and high spectral resolution (G395H/290LP;
										R∼2700), with high spatial resolution (∼ 0.1") and sensitivity. Thanks to the combination of the NIRSpec data and a new lensing model with
										accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the 3"×3" field is crowded, with a lensed arc (C, z=6.3425±0.0002), two galaxies to the south (S1
										and S2, z=6.3592±0.0001), two galaxies to the west (W1, z=6.3550±0.0001; W2, z=6.3628±0.0001), and two low-redshift interlopers (G1,
										z=3.4806±0.0001; G2, z=2.00±0.01). We present spectral fits and morpho-kinematic maps for each bright emission line (e.g., [OIII]λ5007,
										Hα, [NII]λ6584) from the R2700 data for all sources except G2 (whose spectral lines fall outside the observed wavelengths of the R2700 data).
										From a line ratio analysis, the galaxies in component C are likely powered by star formation, while we cannot rule out or confirm the presence
										of AGN in the other high-redshift sources. We perform gravitational lens modelling, finding evidence for a two-source composition of the lensed
										central object and a comparable magnification factor (μ=2.1-2.4) to previous work. The projected distances and velocity offsets of each galaxy
										suggest that they will merge within the next∼1 Gyr. Finally, we examine the dust extinction-corrected SFRHα of each z > 6 source, finding
										that the total star formation (460±90M⊙ yr−1, magnification-corrected but not accounting for AGN contamination) is distributed across the six
										z∼6.34-6.36 objects over a region of diameter∼11 kpc. Altogether, this suggests that HFLS3 is not a single starburst galaxy, but instead is a
										merging system of star-forming galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization. </font>

										 <font color="black">  This paper explores the intriguing environment of LBQS 0302−0019, a blue QSO at z~ 3.3. This target resides in a dynamic 
											 neighborhood that includes an obscured AGN companion and multiple satellite galaxies, all within a projected distance of 30 kpc. 
											 Using the JWST NIRSpec IFS, we obtained high-resolution observations that provided unprecedented insights into this system.
											 Our work involved developing a novel procedure to correct for spurious oscillations in the NIRSpec spectra and employing advanced decomposition tools
											 to differentiate the quasar from its host galaxy.
											Our findings revealed a complex interplay of various components within the QSO environment. We identified a rotating gas disk and a high-velocity 
											 ionized outflow within the QSO host galaxy. Additionally, we detected eight companion objects, including the second, obscured AGN and five previously 
											 unknown companions. These discoveries underscore the significant role of mergers in triggering AGN and driving the rapid growth of SMBHs in the

											In our GA-NIFS program, we have observed a sample of six quasars at z > 6. In this paper we present our results from
											the first two quasars observed, DELS J0411–0907 at z = 6.82 and VDES J0020–3653 at z = 6.86. By observing the Hβ, 
											[OIII]λλ4959, 5007, and Hα emission lines in these high-z quasars for the first time, we measured accurate black hole masses,
											MBH = 1.85×10$^9$ $M_{\odot}$ and 2.9x10$^9$ $M_{\odot}$, corresponding to Eddington ratios of 0.8 and 0.4 for 
											DELS J0411–0907 and VDES J0020–3653, respectively. These provide a key comparison for existing estimates from the more 
											uncertain MgII line. <br>
											We performed quasar–host decomposition using models of the quasars’ broad lines to study the underlying host galaxies,
											measuring their star formation rates, excitation mechanisms, and dynamical masses. DELS J0411–0907 and VDES J0020–3653 
											both lie above the local black hole–host mass relation, and are consistent with the existing observations of z~6 quasar
											host galaxies with ALMA. We also discovered that these quasars are undergoing galaxy-galaxy mergers, with multiple companion 
											galaxies surrounding each of the quasars. We detected ionised outflows in [OIII] and Hβ from both quasars, with mass 
											outflow rates much larger than their host star formation rates. This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of
											the JWST NIRSpec IFU for observing quasars in the early Universe.

											<strong> 2) <font color="#2980B9">  GA-NIFS: A massive black hole in a low-metallicity AGN at z ∼ 5.55 revealed by JWST/NIRSpec IFS</font>, Übler et al. (2023) </strong>

										<font color="black">  
										 	In this paper, we present rest-frame optical data of the compact z = 5.55 galaxy GS_3073. The galaxy's prominent 
											broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines and a detection of a large equivalent width of He IIλ4686,
											EW(He II) ∼20 Å, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measure a gas phase metallicity
											of Zgas/Z⊙∼0.21, which is lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at a similar redshift and 
											lower redshift AGN. We empirically show that classical emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams cannot be used to 
											distinguish between the primary ionisation source -AGN or star formation- for systems with such low metallicity, 
											though different diagnostic diagrams involving He IIλ4686 prove useful, independent of metallicity. We measure the
											central black hole mass to be log(MBH/M⊙)∼8.2 ± 0.4 based on the luminosity and width of the broad line region of 
											the Hα emission. While this places GS_3073 at the lower end of known high-redshift black hole masses, it still 
											appears to be overly massive when compared to its host galaxy's mass properties. We detected an outflow with a 
											projected velocity ≳700 km/s and inferred an ionised gas mass outflow rate of about 100 M⊙/yr, suggesting that 
											one billion years after the Big Bang, GS_3073 is able to enrich the intergalactic medium with metals.

											hydrogen and helium lines, while the forbidden lines are narrow, with a faint red-shifted broader component. 
											Several high-ionisation lines are detected, such as He II and [Ar IV]. Tentative line detections of coronal 
											and auroral emission lines are indicated by dotted lines.</i>
